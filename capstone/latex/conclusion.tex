\section{Conclusion}
Within this project, I have created a predictor that estimates whether a student is rather very or rather less able. During the preprocessing, I mapped the features from the original set onto two new hidden features, describing how correctly students solve the tasks as well as how much time they need to come up with a solution. Both these new features can be easily used by a tutor to describe the students in his/her class. The software can be used to create labels for the students in the data set and to use these labels to train a framework for the prediction of the effectiveness of an exercise.
